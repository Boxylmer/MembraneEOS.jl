# Exposed Functionality
The exposed methods do not apply to all EOS models. The assumption here, until the transition to Clapeyron.jl is made, is that only what is needed in downstream membrane packages is exposed / implemented. If you need some extra functionality for a project, please submit an issue (pull requests also welcome).
