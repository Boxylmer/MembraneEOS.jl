# MembraneEOS.jl

Wrapper for various equation of state (EOS) implementations to be used in the membrane package ecosystem. 

This repository will hopefully soon wrap [Clapeyron.jl](https://github.com/ClapeyronThermo/Clapeyron.jl) for EOS calculations, while providing convenience functions and data for membrane / polymer focused tasks. 


# Sections

## The gist
Explanation will go here of how the structure of this package works
- how to construct a model
- the two ways to get parameters
    - by name
    - by values
- Constructing mixed models
    - KIJ initialization and setting
- unit limitations

## Exposed Functionality
List and docs for methods / accessors for models will go here.

## EOS Models
List of models and links to their pages will go here.

## ChemicalData
List of data and how to initialize it will be here.
